# Horiseon-site-refactor

## Deployed Site: [Horiseon Website](https://kkolyvek.github.io/Horiseon-site-refactor/)

## Description:

This repo contains Horiseon's main page, refactored to be more accessible for the visually impaired through the use of image alt-attributes. Additionally, the HTML has been updated with semantic tags for developers' ease of use and minor fixes to non-functioning links.

### In order to properly refactor, the site retains its original layout:
